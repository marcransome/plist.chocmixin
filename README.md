#plist.chocmixin

A mixin for the [Chocolat](http://www.chocolatapp.com) text editor for Mac that will copy an XML-encoded version of a binary `.plist` file to the clipboard.

##Installation
1. Open the `Action` menu in Chocolat and select the `Install mixins...` item.
2. Find `plist` in the table and click the checkbox next to it's name.
3. There is no step 3.

If you aren't able to find `plist` in the list of available mixins, click the refresh button in the lower left-hand corner of the window and try again.

As an alternative to the procedure above you can manually install by dowloading a project archive (click the `ZIP` icon at the top of this page) and extracting the contents to your `~/Library/Application Support/Chocolat/Mixins/` folder.
